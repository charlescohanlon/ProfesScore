ProfesScore is a web app that gives students insight into professor metrics. With a simple search, you can see a professor's grade ratios, quality rating, and overall score. There are three main methods for searching the data: by professor, by course, or by rating.

When you search by professor (or score), the data shown is department-wide. The ratio and score are from grade data from every class taught by that professor. When you search by course, the ratio and scores shown for each professor are specific to that course. Searching by score will bring up all the professor metrics for professors whose scores fall in the entered range.

ProfesScore is built with Nextjs, Tailwindcss, and Mysql. It implements server-side rendering, infinite scroll, and advanced sql queries.
